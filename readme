R project - forecasting, causal relations, and time series analysis:  

This project was originally submitted for a class called "Social Behavioural Dynamics".  I thought it would be amusing to see if I could find any underlying causal patterns in my daily/weekly routines.  It turns out that there's a lagged (but non-causal) relationship between my grocery shopping and daily steps.

But also, it's where I finally forced myself to learn how to do data preprocessing in R rather than default to Python (or Excel).
